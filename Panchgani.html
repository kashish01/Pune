 The town was discovered by the British as a summer resort in 1860s. Mahabaleshwar was the summer resort of choice for the British, but it was uninhabitable during the monsoons. Panchgani was developed as a retirement place for the British as it remained pleasant throughout the year. John Chesson, a British superintendent, was responsible for the transformation of Panchgani into a summer resort. It is also said that, during Vanavasa, the Pandavas spent some time in Panchgani and the cave where they stayed is the famous Devil's Kitchen.
