 The Temple is up of marble.Each pillar and walls of Temple are worth observing.Each pillar has two Gopis and one elephant engraved at their base.Consistency and accuracy are the key points in the Temple's architecture.The gold embossed alter doors give a stunning look to the Temple.The transparent marble flooring which glows in diffused lights make the Temple interior look mavelous. The dome of the Temple is lotus ;it has a beautiful carving of Goddess Radha and Lord Krishna.The three-dimensional wall paintings on the walls of the Temple are a must watch sight.
