   <p style="text-align:justify">        Lavasa is a private, planned city being built near Pune. It is stylistically based on the Italian town Portofino, with a street and several buildings bearing the name of that town. Planned sports facilities include a Nick Faldo-designed golf course and a Manchester City-branded football academy.

           <h4>Lakeside</h4>
The place is a checkdam reservoir in the valley and has enough water for sports like boating, waterski etc. like any other lake on a place of attraction. The place also has few food joints with poor stock of menu items.
The views here has the beautiful lake and the hills in the background. The scenic views of the place is perfect for photography and spend a calm evening with your loved ones.
