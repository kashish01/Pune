   <p style="text-align:justify">One of the liveliest streets in Pune, Fergusson College Road is a youngster’s delight. Located centrally in the ever-expanding city of Pune, FC Road is home to many of city’s famous restaurants, street food joints, and street shopping areas. Proximity to the city’s premier educational institutes (Fergusson College, BMCC, Apte College, COEP) and city’s residential areas means that this one-way road is always filled with youngsters eager to eat, shop, and hang out. Though the FC Road region has maintained its Puneri identity in a rapidly changing Pune, some things on it have changed beyond recognition.

         <b> HongKong Lane </b>, a narrow lane of crowded and tiny shops connecting FC Road with Jangli Maharaj Road, was set up in 1961 in a relocation scheme by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) after floods consumed a handful of shops located elsewhere. Once popular for selling imported goods (especially imports from Hong Kong), this lane has since diversified, selling a variety of commodities like clothing, junk fashion items, cosmetics, jewelry, luggage, purses and bags, leather/rubber items, and even books.

In 2011, before smartphones had captured the masses, HongKong Lane had three tiny shops which acted as book and magazine stores. While two of these stores sold original and pirated copies of books, the third shop — Tanna Book Depot — sold only originals (new and used) and ran a library of secondhand books. This store even offered 20–30% discounts on the new arrivals — very rare in the pre-Flipkart/Amazon era.

           <p style="text-align:justify">
 Across the road, the manager of the sophisticated and once-famous Popular Book Store sits idle. Nowadays his shop remains largely empty — even on Sunday evenings. As book sales have plummeted to an all-time low for retailers (while e-commerce manages good sales), the manager puts the blame for his sinking business more on smartphones/social media than e-commerce.

    <h3> Food @ FC Road </h3>
A few yards ahead of Popular Book Store along FC Road, Café Goodluck remains unchanged, crowded, and filled with the sumptuous aromas of tea, bread, and meat. One look at the waiting crowds lets you know that this place has been a part of their lives for years, if not decades. Across the signal, further down the street, lies the holy trinity of Puneri — South Indian restaurants Wadeshwar, Roopali and Vaishali. Generations of Punekars have brunched and dined at these places, passing the baton down the generations. It’s pretty common to find old men and women chatting over coffee and snacks in these places while their children and grandchildren wait outside.
