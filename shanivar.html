   <p style="text-align:justify">   A prominent historical landmark in Pune is Shaniwarwada. It is a majestic fortification as well built in 1732 and during that time it was the seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire and they ruled over there until 1818. After they lost control to the British East India Company, they could not use it longer. But when they were in the reign, Shaniwarwada was the centre of Indian politics in the 18th century.

       <p style="text-align:justify">
           But in 1828, the fort was destroyed by a huge fire and later the remnants were transformed to become a tourist site. Shaniwarwada was a seven storied capital building of the Peshwas and they wanted the building to be made of stone alone. However, after the completion of the ground floor, the people of Satara insisted that stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the Shahu King, not the Peshwas. </p>
    

           <p style="text-align:justify">
               With respect to it, the Peshwas were asked to continue the construction of the building by using only bricks. But when the British attacked, only the base floor survived while all the other floors were completely destroyed. Earlier, the fort used to accommodate around thousand people. The major buildings inside the fort are Thora Rayancha Diwankhana or the court reception hall of the eldest royal member, Naachacha Diwankhana which is the dance hall, Juna Arsa Mahal that is the Old Mirror Hall and so on. Since all the buildings were destroyed in the fire, only descriptions of the remaining areas are available currently.</p>  

               <p style="text-align:justify">
                   The doorways were made of teak arches with ornamental teardrop teak pillars shaped like Suru trunks. Ceilings were beautified by numerous chandeliers and the floors were filled with polished marble adorned with rich Persian rugs. The walls displayed paintings depicting the Hindu epics. The top floor of the building enacted as the residence of the Peshwa and it was called Meghadambari.</p>

                   <p style="text-align:justify">
